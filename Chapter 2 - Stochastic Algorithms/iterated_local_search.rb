# Iterated Local Search looks for a best solution in a probabilistic way.
# It is a local search technique that can be used to refine results obtained
# from a global search.
#
# A random solution is sampled from the search space and serves as the seed for
# the walk towards an optimal solution.
# Each step, a random neighboring solution is selected and evaluated. If its
# cost is better than the current best solution, the neighbor is saved as the
# current best solution.
# After a given amount of iterations, the best solution is returned.
# The algorithm can be restarted for an improved result (Restart Hill Climbing)
# or run concurrently so that multiple runs are performed simultaneously
# (Parallel Hill Climbing).
#
# The standard performed problem is a Travelling Salesman Problem called 'Berlin52'.
# The cost function is the distance travelled in a round trip through all cities.
# The optimal solution for Berlin52 is 7542 units.
# Other problems can be defined through changing the one_max and by changing the
# configurations.
